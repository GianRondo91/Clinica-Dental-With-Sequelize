## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

This section is used to describe potential solutions.

Once the ideal, reality, and consequences sections have been
completed, and understood, it becomes easier to provide a solution for solving the problem.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- What are the dependencies of your project?
- Describe each limitation in detailed but concise terms
- Explain why each limitation exists
- Provide the reasons why each limitation could not be overcome using the method(s) chosen to acquire.
- Assess the impact of each limitation in relation to the overall findings and conclusions of your project, and if
  appropriate, describe how these limitations could point to the need for further research.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

Write about what you could not develop during the course of the Hackathon; and about what your project can achieve
in the future.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development
and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Add notes about how to use the system.
